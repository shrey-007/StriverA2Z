    /**
     * Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a positive integer divisor, divide all
     * the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the smallest divisor such that the result mentioned above is
     * less than or equal to threshold.
     * Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element.
     * (For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).
     * The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.
     *
     * The largest element of the array is always the answer kuiki usse divide kro toh sab 1 ban jaaege and sum min aaega.
     * Means ki bade numbers mai se answer aaega
     * Ab vo bade numbers ke set mai se smallest number nikaalo jo ki ans de, so it is BS on answers
