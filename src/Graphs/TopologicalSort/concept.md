1. it only exists for DAG(directed acyclic graph). Obvously it is common sense ki undirected graph and cyclic graph mai esi ordering banegi hi nhi kabhi.
2. linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u and v , then u appears before v in that ordering. There can be many linear ordering which follows this constraint.
3. It can be done using BFS,DFS. When we do it using BFS, we called it Kahn's algorithm
